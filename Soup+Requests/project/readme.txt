This script uses BS4 and requests to download the table of the Nobel Prize
 (in physics) winners from wikipidia. 

Using this data is can return a tally count of total nationalities included
which can then be further displayed in a plotmatlib pie chart.

This has been extended so that I can request winners between certain time 
periods in order to gain a specific time framed ratio.

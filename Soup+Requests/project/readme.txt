This script uses BS4 and requests to download the table of the Nobel Prize
 (in physics) winners from wikipidia. 

Using this data it can return a tally count of total nationalities included,
which can then be further displayed in a plotmatlib pie chart.

Further implementation has been added so that a request is between a certain
time period to gain specific data.
